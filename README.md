## Study Log: Basic Algorithm Practices and Problem Solving with Loops

This study session focused on improving my problem-solving skills using basic programming algorithms and loop structures. By solving various difficulty level questions, I had the opportunity to experience different usage scenarios of both **for** and **while** loops.  Additionally, I practiced making my algorithms more dynamic and problem-oriented with **if-else** conditional statements.

**Overview of Solved Questions:**

In this session, I tackled a wide range of problem-solving exercises, from numerical operations to arrays, patterns to games. I mainly focused on the following topics:

*   **Basic Mathematical Operations:** I learned how to implement basic mathematical algorithms such as calculating the average of numbers taken from the user, finding factorials, and reversing numbers using loops.
*   **Prime Number Control and Number Theory:** I developed an algorithm to check if a number is prime using **for loop** and **if-else** structures. I also deepened my algorithmic thinking skills by solving number theory-based problems like Armstrong numbers.
*   **Pattern Generation with Loops:** I practiced how to generate number patterns like the Fibonacci sequence using a **for loop**. This helped me understand how effectively loops can manage repetitive tasks.
*   **Simple Game Algorithms:** By coding the basic algorithms of simple games like the number guessing game with **while loop** and **if-else** structures, I laid the foundation for developing user-interactive programs.

**Gains:**

Thanks to this study session, I achieved significant gains in the following areas:

*   **Mastery of Loop Structures:** I increased my mastery of loop structures by learning to use **for** and **while** loops effectively in different problem types. I better understood which loop type is more appropriate in which situation through experience.
*   **Algorithm Control with Conditional Statements:** I reinforced how to use **if-else** conditional statements to control the flow of my algorithms and change their behavior according to different scenarios.
*   **Development of Algorithmic Thinking Skills:** I gained practice in breaking down problems into smaller parts, designing step-by-step solutions, and translating these steps into code with loops and conditional statements.
*   **Basic Programming Logic:** My confidence increased in developing simple but functional programs using basic programming building blocks such as variables, operators, loops, and conditional statements.

**Conclusion:**

This study session was a very valuable experience to strengthen my basic programming skills and improve my algorithmic thinking ability. Thanks to the various problems I solved, I better understood the importance of loops and conditional statements in programming. These practices enabled me to build a solid foundation before starting to work on more complex algorithms and projects.

**Looking Ahead:**

In the next step, I plan to work on more complex algorithms and data structures using this basic knowledge. Perhaps I can develop a small project using what I have learned.
